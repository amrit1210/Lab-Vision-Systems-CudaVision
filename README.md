# Lab-Vision-Systems-CudaVision ( Learning Computer Vision on GPUs )

Assignment 1 : Performing Logistic Regression on CIFAR-10 dataset with softmax activation (using pure numpy)

Assignment 2 : Performing Logistic Regression on CIFAR-10 dataset with K-fold cross validation (using pyorch)

Assignment 3 :- (i) Add regularization to your CFAR-10 model (Dropout, L1, and L2) (ii) Find out how deep the model can be and still improving (iii)Draw confusion matrix (iv) Use five different optimizers and compare their results and convergence time (SGD, Adam, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop) (v) Use three different activation functions (ReLu, Tanh, Sigmoid)

Assignment 4 :- (i) Train a CNN for CIFAR-10 with the best hyperparameters (ii) Visualize output image of each Conv filter (iii) Visualize kernel of each Conv filter (iv) Find out what works better in CIFAR-10? MaxPooling or AvgPooling

Assignment 5:- Fine tuning a pretrained network
