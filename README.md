# Lab-Vision-Systems-CudaVision ( Learning Computer Vision on GPUs )

Assignment 1 : Performing Logistic Regression on CIFAR-10 dataset with softmax activation (using pure numpy)

Assignment 2 : Performing Logistic Regression on CIFAR-10 dataset with K-fold cross validation (using pyorch)

Assignment 3 :- (i) Add regularization to your CFAR-10 model (Dropout, L1, and L2) (ii) Find out how deep the model can be and still improving (iii)Draw confusion matrix (iv) Use five different optimizers and compare their results and convergence time (SGD, Adam, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop) (v) Use three different activation functions (ReLu, Tanh, Sigmoid)

Assignment 4 :- (i) Train a CNN for CIFAR-10 with the best hyperparameters (ii) Visualize output image of each Conv filter (iii) Visualize kernel of each Conv filter (iv) Find out what works better in CIFAR-10? MaxPooling or AvgPooling

Assignment 6 :- Train an Auto Encoder model for CIFAR 10 with the best hyperparameters

Assignment 7 :- Build an LSTM and a GRU model for MNIST dataset

Assignment 8 :- Generator - Descriminator model for the soccerball dataset

Project :- (i) Implement SweatyNet1 model from Homonoids Robocup workshop 2017 for detection and localization of Soccer ball, (ii) Train a convLSTM model on top of it with continuous sequence of frames, (iii) Calculate recall and false detection rate to check accuracy of model.
